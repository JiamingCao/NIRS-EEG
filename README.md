# NIRS-EEG
Codes for paper Enhanced spatio-temporal reconstruction of neuronal activities using joint electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy

*PrepFEM2.m*: generates the forward models of EEG and NIRS

*EEG_nirs_prior.m*: main script to simulate the reconstruction

## Requires:
- Fieldtrip
- NIRSFAST
- iso2mesh
